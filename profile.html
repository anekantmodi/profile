      Hi, my name is Anekant Jain. I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and have developed a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms along with practical skills in front-end web development.

I’ve gained hands-on experience by building projects like “Gana Bajana,” a front-end-only Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which helped me understand responsive design, layout structuring, and user interactions. I also completed an Industrial Training Program at Younity, where I improved my technical thinking and real-world problem-solving abilities.

In addition, I recently completed the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation, where I worked with Tableau to analyze and visualize business data — expanding my understanding of how front-end development and data analytics come together in practical scenarios.
I’m passionate about learning new technologies, solving real-world problems, and continuously improving my coding and UI/UX skills. I’m currently focused on becoming a full-stack developer and looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and grow as a professional.
